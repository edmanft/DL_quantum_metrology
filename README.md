# DL_quantum_metrology

This repository contains the code I developed as part of two research grants: "Beca de colaboraci칩n" from the Spanish Ministry and the GEFES Research Awards 2021. 
In this project I worked in the research line of quantum metrology and AI of my advisor Carlos S치nchez Mu침oz, department of Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics at 
Universidad Aut칩noma de Madrid. 

Here we study the application of MLP and other Deep Learning architectures to the problem of quantum parameter estimation of a 2-Level System excited by a laser.
We try to measure the detunning of the laser via photon counting. This work will be published at the GEFES webpage as per the requisites of the grant.
